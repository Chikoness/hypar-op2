3D NON-HYDROSTATIC UNIFIED MODEL OF THE ATMOSPHERE (NUMA)

Rising Thermal Bubble (2D):

This case simulates the rising thermal bubble in an ambient
atmosphere in hydrostatic balance. The initial solution 
comprises the balanced atmosphere with a temperature pertur-
bation.

Domain:

  0 <= x,z <= 1000.0 (meters)
  No-Flux boundary conditions (invisic wall) on all
  x and z boundaries.

  Along y, to run a 2D case using a 3D solver, periodic
  boundary conditions are specified.

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters

+ weno.inp      -   an optional input file specifying
                    some options for the WENO finite-
                    difference scheme.

Notes:-
The code aux/init.C is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver. 
The exact solution file also needs to be in the same format.
