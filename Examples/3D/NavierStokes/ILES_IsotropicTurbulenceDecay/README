Domain:

  0 <= x,y,z < 2pi
  "periodic" boundary conditions

The initial solution is specified in the Fourier space (with an energy
distribution similar to that of turbulent flow), and then transformed 
to the physical space through an inverse transform.

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physics-related parameters
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution

** In solver.inp, the field "input_mode" is set to "parallel". Thus, 
the code would need the initial solution in a file called 
"initial_par.inp". This file contains the initial solution split into
the MPI subdomains. All the MPI processes read it, thus bypassing the
allocation of the global domain on the root process and then distrib-
uting the solution to other ranks.

"initial_par.inp" can be generated from "initial.inp" by compiling and
running "hypar/Extras/ParallelInput.c" after specifying the number of
processors ("iproc") in "solver.inp".

Notes:-
The code aux/init.C is an example to generate the initial solution
file in the correct format required by the solver.  

The code aux/fourier.C can be used to calculate the initial and
final spectrum of the solution. 

** Both these codes need the fftw3 library (http://www.fftw.org). 
To compile:
g++ -I/path/to/fftw3.h -L/path/to/libfftw3.a -lfftw3 fourier.C
