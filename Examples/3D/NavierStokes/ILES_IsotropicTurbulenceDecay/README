Domain:

  0 <= x,y,z < 2pi
  "periodic" boundary conditions

The initial solution is specified in the Fourier space (with an energy
distribution similar to that of turbulent flow), and then transformed 
to the physical space through an inverse transform.

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physics-related parameters
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution

Notes:-
The code aux/init.C is an example to generate the initial solution
file in the correct format required by the solver.  

The code aux/fourier.C can be used to calculate the initial and
final spectrum of the solution. 

** Both these codes need the fftw3 library (http://www.fftw.org). 
To compile:
g++ -I/path/to/fftw3.h -L/path/to/libfftw3.a -lfftw3 fourier.C
