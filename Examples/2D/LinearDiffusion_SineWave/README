2D LINEAR DIFFUSION

  du         d^2 u        d^2 u
  --  = nu_x ----- + nu_y ----- 
  dt         dx^2          dy^2

  0 <= x,y <= 1; Periodic
  nu_x = diffusion coefficient along x
  nu_y = diffusion coefficient along y

Initial Solution:
  
  u(x,y,0) = u0(x,y) = sin(m pi x) sin(n pi y)
  (m = n = 2)

Exact solution:
                               
  u(x,y,t) = exp(-pi^2 (nu_x*m^2 + nu_y*n^2) t) u0(x,y)
                                 

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters 
                    (diffusion coeffs along each dimension)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.C)
+ exact.inp     -   Exact solution (optional)
                    (can be used to compute error norms)

Notes:-
The code aux/init.C is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver. 
The exact solution file also needs to be in the same format
(can be generated by aux/exact.C).

For Tecplot users, the file solution.lay is a layout to visualize
the solution (op_file_format should be "tecplot2d" in solver.inp)
