1D NONLINEAR BURGERS EQUATION

  du     d (0.5 u^2)
  --  +  ----------  = 0
  dt         dx

  0 <= x <= 1; Periodic

Initial Solution:
  u(x,0) = u0(x) = sin(2*pi*x) / 4*pi

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.C)
+ exact.inp     -   Exact solution (optional)
                    (can be used to compute error norms)

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver. 
The exact solution file also needs to be in the same format.
