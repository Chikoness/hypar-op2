    MATLAB SCRIPTS
------------------------------

This folder has some MATLAB scripts which can be used to 
quickly test the spectral properties of numerical schemes.

+ Scripts named 'SpectralAnalysis_Space_xxx.m' test the spectral
  properties of the spatial discretization operators for a suitable
  example of physical model 'xxx'.

+ Scripts named 'SpectralAnalysis_Time_xxx.m' test the spectral
  properties of the algorithm for various time-integration methods
  and time step sizes for a suitable example of physical model 'xxx'.
