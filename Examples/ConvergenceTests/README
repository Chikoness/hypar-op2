    MATLAB SCRIPTS
------------------------------

This folder has some MATLAB scripts which can be used to 
quickly test convergence and errors of numerical schemes.

+ Scripts named 'ConvergenceSpace_xxx.m' test the convergence
  properties of the spatial discretization operator for a smooth
  solution of physical model 'xxx'.

+ Scripts named 'ConvergenceTime_xxx.m' test the convergence
  properties of the time-integration scheme for a smooth 
  solution of physical model 'xxx'.
