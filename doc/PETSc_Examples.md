PETSc Examples
==============

The following are some examples that use implicit or semi-implicit (IMEX) time
integration. To run them, HyPar needs to be compiled \b with \b PETSc.
\b Note that familiarity with using PETSc (https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) is assumed.
In general, any example or simulation can use PETSc time-integrators (assuming
HyPar is compiled with PETSc) by specifying the PETSc inputs through a 
<B>.petscrc</B> file. The file 
+ <B>hypar/Examples/PETScInputs/.petscrc_Example</B> 

is an example of a .petscrc file (with explanatory comments).
