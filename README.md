HyPar - Hyperbolic-Parabolic Partial Differential Equations Solver: A finite-difference algorithm to solve hyperbolic-parabolic equations (with source term). The hyperbolic terms are discretized using a conservative finite-difference scheme (eg: 1st order UPWIND, 3rd order MUSCL, 5th order WENO, 5th order CRWENO). The parabolic terms are discretized either using a conservative or a non-conservative scheme. Time integration is carried out using the first order Euler or higher order multi-stage Runge-Kutta schemes. Examples of physical models include the linear advection-diffusion-reaction, Euler equations, Fokker-Planck equations for power systems, etc. For more details, see README.
