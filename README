HyPar - Hyperbolic-Parabolic Partial Differential Equations Solver

A finite-difference algorithm to solve hyperbolic-parabolic equations 
of the following form:

    du        d [f_i(u)]         d^2 [g_i(u)]
   ----   +  ------------   =  ----------------  ;   0 < i <= ndims
    dt           dx_i             d (x_i)^2          (implied summation)

where
  u     -> state vector of size nvar
  f     -> hyperbolic flux function
  g     -> parabolic  function
  ndims -> number of space dimensions
  (^ denotes superscript and _ denotes subscript)

The domain, x1_i < x_i < x2_i (where x1_i and x2_i are the upper and 
lower bounds of x_i) is discretized with a Cartesian grid.
