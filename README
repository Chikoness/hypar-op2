HyPar - Hyperbolic-Parabolic Partial Differential Equations Solver

A finite-difference algorithm to solve hyperbolic-parabolic equations 
of the following form:

    du        d [f_i(u)]         d^2 [g_i(u)]
   ----   +  ------------   =  ---------------- + S(u)  ;   0 < i <= ndims
    dt           dx_i             d (x_i)^2                 (implied summation)

where
  u     -> state vector of size nvar
  f     -> hyperbolic flux function
  g     -> parabolic  function
  S     -> source term
  ndims -> number of space dimensions
  (^ denotes superscript and _ denotes subscript)

The domain, x1_i < x_i < x2_i (where x1_i and x2_i are the upper and 
lower bounds of x_i) is discretized with a Cartesian grid.

The solver provides a standardized template for discretization schemes and 
physical models. New physical models can be easily incorporated by defining 
the following functions for them:-
- Hyperbolic function  
- Parabolic function   
- Source function      
- Upwinding function if hyperbolic function present
- CFL and Diffusion number computation functions
Existing physical models provide a template.
Similarly, new discretization schemes can be added easily by following the 
existing template. The only restriction is that any new discretization scheme
for the hyperbolic terms needs to be conservative (i.e., only the function to
interpolate interface fluxes needs to be specified).

COMPILING:-

If obtained by cloning the GIT/SVN repository, run these commands:-
> autoreconf -i

This will generate the required files for:
> [CFLAGS="..."] ./configure [--with-mpidir=/path/to/mpi] [--prefix=/install/dir]
> make
> make install

If unpacked from tarball, then proceed with ./configure, make and
make install.

** A serial version can be compiled using the "-Dserial" compile flag.
** If MPI is unavailable or the configure script is unable to detect MPI, then a 
   serial version of the code will get compiled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RUNNING:-

> [/path/to/mpi/bin/]mpiexec -n $NPROC /path/to/HyPar_binary

Note: $NPROC needs to be equal to the product of the "iproc" entries in the input
      file "solver.inp".

See section "INPUT FILES" for a list of required input files and their explanations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXAMPLES:-

The folder $(top_srcdir)/Examples contains several examples with all the input files
required to run a case.

  Explanation:
    nb  -> number of boundary conditions
    Followed by nb lines, 1 for each boundary condition, of the format as 
    shown above

    bctype      -> type of boundary condition 
                   ("periodic", "extrapolate", "dirichlet", etc)
                   (see include/boundaryconditions.h for a complete list)

                   (0 <= dim < ndims)
    var         -> variable on which to apply this boundary conditions 
                   (0 <= var < nvars)
    face        -> face on which to apply this boundary condition 
                   (1 -> left/xmin; -1 -> right/xmax)

    xNmin, xNmax -> extent of this boundary condition along dimension N
                    note: the values for N=dim are ignored.
                    This needs to be specified for all the dimensions 
                    0 <= N < ndims

- initial.inp
  
  The initial solution - The cases in Examples contain codes "init.C" to 
                         generate this input file in the correct format. 
                         They can be modified to generate different initial 
                         conditions (or use different codes as long as it 
                         outputs the initial conditions in the same format 
                         as "init.C")

- exact.inp (**Optional**)

  The exact solution, if available - used to calculate the numerical errors. 
  The format of this file is same  as that of "initial.inp"

- physics.inp
  
  Format

      <keyword>     <value>
      <keyword>     <value>
      ...
      <keyword>     <value>
    <end>

  Physics-specific parameters (eg. advection speed, diffusion coefficient, 
  etc). Keywords are specific to the physical model, so consult an example 
  of a specific physical model to see the required parameters for that model.
